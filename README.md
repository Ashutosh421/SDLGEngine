# SDLGEngine

This project contains a small SDL Engine Library I have created that you can use for your projects to create basic games in SDL2.
The game is rendered in SDL2 Renderer , you can create SDL Textures, Sprite Animations and use the Input Wrapper Functions to make
your life much easier and project ececution faster. Along with the SDL Game Library it contains a Sandbox Game, Tappy Plane which uses
the SDL Game Library.
